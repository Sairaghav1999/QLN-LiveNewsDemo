His Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin is faring rather better.\n\nBack home in Russia, political figures have been lining up to praise the results of the Helsinki summit.\n\n\"This is the first important step towards establishing a political dialogue,\" concluded Valentina Matvienko, speaker of the Upper House of the Russian parliament.\n\n\"We saw two leaders who wanted to come together to find common ground,\" noted senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev.\n\nThe pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda consulted a body language expert in an effort to portray President Putin as the stronger leader.\n\n\"When he shakes hands, Donald Trump normally extends an open palm to trick his opponent into believing he is open for contact. Then he drags his opponent's hand towards him to put them off balance.\n\n\"But in Helsinki he shook Putin's hand quite normally, without any cunning moves. It reflects the results of the meeting and what has happened over the last year: Trump has failed to dominate Putin.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment President Trump meets counterpart Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets claimed that \"a quiet, modest Trump had paled in comparison with Vladimir Putin. It's clear that Putin outmanoeuvred the US president. That is cause for pride, but also for alarm. Because outmanoeuvring Trump does not mean he outmanoeuvred the US political class. I fear it won't be long before Washington responds\".\n\nThat highlights a potential problem for the Kremlin post-Helsinki.\n\nMr Trump may, on paper, be the perfect American president for Moscow. At the news conference in Helsinki, he may have sided with the Kremlin over his own intelligence agencies on the issue of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. He may have declined to blame Moscow alone for the poor state of US-Russian relations. He may have pledged that his administration will work with Russia to resolve all their differences.\n\nBut will Mr Trump be in a position to deliver?\n\nHis comments in Helsinki have sparked such anger in America that the US political elite is likely to view any attempt by the Trump administration to mend fences with Moscow with the deepest suspicion.\n\nFormer CIA director John Brennan called President Trump's news conference with Vladimir Putin \"nothing short of treasonous\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @JohnBrennan Donald Trump’s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of “high crimes & misdemeanors.” It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump’s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you??? — John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) July 16, 2018 Report\n\nThe top Republican in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan, publicly contradicted Mr Trump, claiming: \"There is no question that Russia interfered in our election and continues attempts to undermine democracy here and around the world… the president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally.\"\n\nRepublican Senator John McCain described Donald Trump's performance in Helsinki as \"disgraceful\".\n\nAdd to that the ongoing investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the US election, and it becomes clear that, in this febrile atmosphere, an American president who wants to \"get along with Russia\" has little room for manoeuvre.",

The damage inflicted by President Trump’s naiveté, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,” McCain said in a blistering statement.\n\n“No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant.”\n\nI've seen Russian intelligence manipulate many people over my professional career and I never would have thought that the US President would become one of the ones getting played by old KGB hands. Rep. Will Hurd (@HurdOnTheHill) July 16, 2018\n\nTaking direct issue with the president who appointed him, Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said US spy agencies have been “clear” and “fact-based” in their assessment that Moscow interfered in the presidential race two years ago an assessment that Trump refused to endorse in Helsinki.\n\nCoats added that Russia remains behind “ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy\".\n\nDenial came after 12 Russians indicted\n\nTrump stunned US political allies and foes alike with his answer to a question about Russian hacking and interference in the 2016 election which saw him defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nPutin “just said it is not Russia. I will say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be,” Trump said.\n\nDonald Trumpâs press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of âhigh crimes & misdemeanors.â It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trumpâs comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you??? John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) July 16, 2018\n\nThat came three days after the US Justice Department indicted 12 Russians for hacking Democratic Party computers, the latest in a series of actions taken by the US government since late 2016 in retribution for what intelligence agencies say was a broad plan to support Trump’s election campaign directed by Putin himself.\n\nYet Trump appeared to take Putin’s word in dismissing that conclusion.\n\n“I have great confidence in my intelligence people. But I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.”\n\nTrump also appeared to embrace Putin’s offer to have Russian investigators work together with US prosecutors on the case of the 12 just indicted.\n\n“I think that’s an incredible offer.”\n\nThis was the day an American president stood on foreign soil next to a murderous lying thug and refused to back his own country. Patriots need to stand up and reject the behavior of this president. James Comey (@Comey) July 16, 2018\n\nAstonished Republicans and Democrats uniformly condemned Trump, with harsh criticism coming even from hosts on Fox News a network normally friendly to the president.\n\n“The president must appreciate that Russia is not our ally,” said Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\n“There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,” he said.\n\nSenior Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Trump’s answer on meddling “will be seen by Russia as a sign of weakness\".\n\n#Putinâs interference in 2016 didnât elect Trump & it doesnât mean we donât deal with him on other issues. But we canât afford to forget he always exploits weakness. If we donât acknowledge & punish what he did,his next attack on us will be bolder,more brazen & far more damaging. Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 16, 2018\n\nBent on forging a personal bond with the Kremlin chief, Trump headed into the summit blaming the “stupidity” of his predecessors for plunging ties to their present low.\n\n“This is shameful,” said Senator Jeff Flake, a fellow Republican and staunch critic of the president.\n\n“I never thought I would see the day when our American president would stand on the stage with the Russian president and place blame on the United States for Russian aggression.”\n\n‘Green light to interfere’\n\nThe language used by Democrats was much harsher, including accusations of “treason.”\n\nStarting with the presidentâs trip to NATO and ending with his shameful performance at todayâs press conference, @realDonaldTrump has strengthened our adversaries while weakening our defenses and those of our allies. Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 16, 2018\n\n“For the president of the United States to side with President Putin against American law enforcement, American defence officials, and American intelligence agencies is thoughtless, dangerous, and weak,” said Chuck Schumer, the senior Democrat in the Senate.\n\nDemocratic California Representative Jimmy Gomez charged: “To side with Putin over US intelligence is disgusting; to fail to defend the US is on the verge of treason.”\n\nEvery single day, I find myself asking: what do the Russians have on @realDonaldTrump personally, financially, & politically? The answer to that question is that only thing that explains his behavior & his refusal to stand up to Putin. #ABetterDeal Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) July 16, 2018\n\nCongressman Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump had given Putin “a green light to interfere in 2018\".\n\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy was blunter: “This entire trip has just been one giant middle finger from President Trump to his own country. Just jaw dropping,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\nCoats’ statement was seen as an uncommonly brusque pushback by the US intelligence community against the White House.\n\nRetired spy chiefs were more direct however.\n\nCoat’s predecessor, James Clapper, called Trump’s acquiescence to Putin “an incredible capitulation\", while former CIA chief John Brennan labelled it \"nothing short of treasonous\".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nDate created : 2018-07-17",

Used in everything from t-shirts to sports bras, the material is popular in sportswear because it dries quickly and weighs little.\n\nAdidas (ADDDF) also said it would stop using virgin plastic in its offices, retail outlets, warehouses and distribution centers, a move that would save an estimated 40 tons of plastic per year, starting in 2018.\n\nAdidas is the latest in a series of global companies that have pledged to reduce plastic use.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) plans to eliminate plastic straws from its stores, and McDonald's (MCD) is trialing a similar program in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

I don't see any reason why it would be,\" he replied.\n\nMr Trump also blamed poor relations with Russia on past US administrations rather than Russian actions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: \"There was nobody to collude with\"\n\nUS intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scale of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media.\n\nMr Trump later backtracked, tweeting that he had \"great confidence in my intelligence people\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump As I said today and many times before, “I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people.” However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #HELSINKI2018 — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2018 Report\n\nWhat has US reaction been?\n\nIn a strongly-worded statement, Mr Ryan said: \"There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals.\n\nHe added that there was \"no question\" Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nSen McCain, a key member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said it was a \"disgraceful performance\" by a US president.\n\n\"No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant,\" Mr McCain said in a statement.\n\nAnother senior Republican, Sen Lindsey Graham, also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tweeted that it was a \"missed opportunity... to firmly hold Russia accountable for 2016 meddling\".\n\nIn a series of tweets, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump's actions had \"strengthened our adversaries while weakening our defences and those of our allies\".\n\nSkip Twitter post by @SenSchumer For the president of the United States to side with President Putin against American law enforcement, American defense officials, and American intelligence agencies is thoughtless, dangerous, and weak. The president is putting himself over our country. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 16, 2018 Report\n\nThe US Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats, also issued a statement saying that the intelligence community had been clear about Russia's \"ongoing, pervasive attempts\" to undermine US democracy.\n\nFormer CIA director John Brennan said Mr Trump's news conference \"was nothing short of treasonous\".\n\n\"Not only were Trump's comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???\" he tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice-President Mike Pence, in a speech at the US Department of Commerce, defended the summit and praised President Trump.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @ABCPolitics Vice Pres. Pence praises the Trump-Putin summit: \"Disagreements between our countries were discussed at length, but what the world saw, what the American people saw, is that Pres. Donald Trump will always put the prosperity and security of America first.\" https://t.co/XgDyYJmHcw pic.twitter.com/upfPij9vBD — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 16, 2018 Report\n\nSome US politicians had called for the summit to be cancelled after 12 Russian military intelligence agents were indicted last week, accused of hacking Hillary Clinton's election campaign.\n\nWhat did President Putin say?\n\nSpeaking at the joint news conference, President Putin offered to allow US investigators to visit Russia to question the officers.\n\nHe made it clear that, in return, Russia would want similar access to people in the US it suspects of criminal activity.\n\nIn a later interview with Fox News, Mr Putin said it was \"utterly ridiculous\" that some people thought Russia could have influenced the US elections.\n\nHe said US-Russian relations should not be \"held hostage\" to an internal political struggle in America.\n\nAfter Helsinki, the fallout at home\n\nAnalysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher\n\nWith no tangible results from the summit, the two leaders are framing this as the first of many meetings to come\n\nGiven the American reaction from across the political spectrum, however, future meetings may be difficult to pull off.\n\nAfter a week abroad, Mr Trump on Monday delivered the coup de grace for what has been a highly disruptive week in US foreign affairs.\n\nEuropean allies are uneasy. US-Russia relations are uncertain. And the US political world - and even the White House's own communications team - is unsettled.\n\nMr Putin described the Helsinki meeting as \"candid and useful\" while Mr Trump said there had been \"deeply productive dialogue\".\n\nMr Trump said US-Russia relations had \"never been worse\" than before they met, but that had now changed.\n\nRelations between Russia and the West were severely strained by Moscow's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.",
